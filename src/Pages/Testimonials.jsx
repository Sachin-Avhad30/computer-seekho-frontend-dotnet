            When I first heard the decision about online classes, I was scared .. But all our faculty have proven that online teaching is just as good in fact in some ways much better than that of physical classrooms. If we miss some concepts due to some reason like electricity failure then we don't have to worry about that because college provides us recordings within 1 hour after each lecture.. So we can cover it all.. And with online training ,SM VITA conducts regular vivas which helps every student to remember and revise each and every concept and it also boosts our confidence.
There is also GD session in which all group members discuss about the topics covered till that date and get the doubts solved. which helps a lot in our study .. Also our seniors conducts mock interviews for us.. So I think SM VITA has been giving there 200% efforts in teaching.. so because of that Im not feeling any difference between online and physical learning

            I attended the physical batch for a month before lockdown and now
            our online batch is going on. In my opinion, if any student gets a
            chance to be integrated with SM VITA he/she should definitely grab
            the opportunity.
            <br /><br />
            It maybe online batch or physical batch. SM VITA takes lot of
            efforts to help us grow.
            <br /><br />
            Yes physical batch is better than online batch as we have 8 hours
            lectures and classroom training helps us focus more. Online batch
            is about more efforts from our side.
            <br /><br />
            Most of the faculties are experts in teaching like Vyas sir, Nitin
            sir, Ketaki mam.
            <br /><br />
            To conclude, if you have good internet facilities and pc/laptop u
            can definitely go for the online batch.

  I belong to the DAC-FEB20 batch. During our initial period at CDAC,
  the nationwide lockdown started, and after that the entire learning
  process shifted to online sessions. At first, like many students,
  I was unsure about how effective online learning would be for such
  a practical and intensive course.
  <br /><br />
  However, the faculty at SM VITA played a very important role in making
  this transition smooth and effective. All the trainers have a very
  friendly nature and are extremely supportive. They are always ready
  to clear doubts, guide students, and motivate them whenever required.
  <br /><br />
 
  Every trainer at SM VITA has a very good level of knowledge, and each
  of them is unique in their respective field. Their explanations are
  clear, practical, and supported with real-world examples, which makes
  understanding complex concepts much easier.
  <br /><br />
  Initially, I believed that online sessions would come with many
  disadvantages, especially for practical learning. But when it came
  to actual implementation, SM VITA managed it at the best possible
  level by maintaining proper interaction, discipline, and regular
  assessments.
  <br /><br />
  I personally experienced that the lectures were conducted with almost
  one-to-one interaction between students and faculty members. This
  helped in staying engaged throughout the sessions and ensured that
  learning quality was not compromised despite the online mode.

          I am happy to share my experience about online training mode by SM VITA. It is one of the best CDAC center. The faculty in the SM VITA have very friendly nature and they are very supportive.
Also most important thing is that teachers are teaching from the industry point of view. Means on which topic industry is working more, which things we should make stronger and all. All the trainer provided by SM VITA have a very good level of knowledge and they are all unique in their related field.
The lectures are conducting with good internet bandwidth. If a student has difficult in understanding a single concept, the faculty are repeating the topic again. Means teachers give us in individual attention. So it is very good for us. Also faculty provides us lots of assignments because of which we get stronger in the subject. The notes provided by the faculty are very effective] . Faculty arrange daily breakout rooms for us, so that each project group members can discuss the topics which are covered in classroom, solve doubts and share ideas. The regular viva taken by the faculty helps me understand where I need to improve. Frequent MCQ tests help us prepare well for the CCEE. At the end of each module our mentors from the Industry not only take our interview but also share their knowledge with us guide us on which topics we should focus and all. So our interview are taking as industries perspective so it will very beneficial for us at the time of facing final interviews. So my overall experience of online training mode is very good. SM VITA providing a very effective platform to learning and improving our knowledge and skills as industry perspective. I am happy to say as, i am a part of SM VITA.
